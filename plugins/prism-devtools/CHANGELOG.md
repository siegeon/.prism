# Changelog

All notable changes to the PRISM Development System plugin will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.4.0] - 2026-02-17

### Added
- **Pre-Commit Quality Gate** — Git pre-commit hook preventing broken content from being committed to `.prism`
  - Runs full documentation validation (validate-docs.py, 6-phase scan) as Phase 1
  - Runs portability check (check-portability.py, PC001-PC005) as Phase 2
  - Blocks commit on CRITICAL doc issues or PC001-PC003 portability errors
  - Warnings (PC004-PC005) printed as advisory but non-blocking
  - Source tracked at `scripts/pre-commit`, installed to `.git/hooks/pre-commit`

- **check-portability.py** — Deterministic portability checker implementing PC001-PC005 rules
  - PC001 (Error): Drive letter in instruction context (`[A-Z]:\\`)
  - PC002 (Error): Hardcoded username path (`C:\Users\{username}\`)
  - PC003 (Error): Hardcoded OneDrive org name (`OneDrive - {OrgName}`)
  - PC004 (Warning): `$env:USERPROFILE` with org-specific subdirectory
  - PC005 (Warning): Absolute path where relative would work
  - Five exemption layers: placeholder tokens, output code blocks, rule documentation, Python tracebacks, historical narrative (both 5-line window and section-level heading hierarchy)
  - Forward-scan heading stack for code-block-aware section detection
  - JSON output matching validate-refs.py style, exit codes 0/1/2
  - Zero external dependencies (stdlib only)

- **validate-all Skill** — Unified validation runner for manual "run all checks" invocation
  - Runs all three validators: validate-docs.py, validate-refs.py, check-portability.py
  - Human-readable summary with per-check PASS/FAIL status
  - Invocable via `/validate-all`, "validate all", or "run all checks"
  - Auto-discovers script locations relative to plugin root

### Changed
- **portability-checker Agent** — Now has a deterministic script counterpart
  - Agent definition (`agents/portability-checker.md`) remains for AI-driven scanning
  - New `scripts/check-portability.py` provides deterministic, scriptable alternative
  - Both share the same PC001-PC005 rule set and exemption logic

## [2.3.1] - 2026-02-13

### Changed
- **BYOS skill matching** — `phase:` frontmatter field no longer required; skills are matched by `agent` only. Existing skills with `phase:` still work (silently ignored).
- **Loop step content externalized** — Step instructions moved from inline Python strings to `hooks/core-steps/*.md` files, making loop behavior easier to read and edit without touching Python.
- **File reorganization** — Checklists moved into `skills/execute-checklist/checklists/`, QA gate artifacts into `skills/qa-gate/artifacts/`, validation stories into `skills/shared/reference/`. Old `checklists/` and `artifacts/` top-level directories removed.
- **Documentation restructured** — README.md and docs/index.md now lead with 3-tier usage hierarchy (loop → agent → skill) instead of role-based organization. Installation moved to bottom of README.

### Fixed
- **13 broken documentation links** — Updated references across 5 files pointing to old `checklists/` and `artifacts/qa/gates/` paths after file reorganization
- **2 ghost checklist entries** — Removed `sprint-planning-checklist.md` (never existed) and `strangler-migration-checklist.md` (deleted) from execute-checklist skill

## [2.3.0] - 2026-02-12

### Added
- **Bring Your Own Skill (BYOS) v1.0.0** — Create and manage project-level skills shared via git with automatic PRISM agent assignment
  - **`/byos scaffold <name>`** — Scaffolds `.claude/skills/{name}/` with pre-filled SKILL.md, reference/ directory, and optional `prism:` agent metadata
  - **`/byos validate [name]`** — Validates skill structure, YAML frontmatter, `prism:` metadata (agent/priority), stray .md files, and token budget
  - **`/byos list`** — Lists all project-level skills with their PRISM agent assignments
  - **Scaffold script** (`scaffold_skill.py`) — Validates kebab-case names, prevents overwriting existing skills
  - **Validate script** (`validate_skill.py`) — Checks required fields, validates agent against `sm|dev|qa|architect`, warns on deprecated `phase:` field, TODO placeholders, and oversized bodies
  - **Agent-only assignment** — Skills declare `prism.agent` only; the system resolves phase(s) from the workflow step map. QA skills auto-inject into both red and review phases.
  - **Reference documentation** — Getting started guide, copy-paste skill template with all fields, and 3 real-world examples (team code standards/dev, test patterns/qa, architecture guard/architect)
  - Leverages existing `discover_prism_skills()` infrastructure in `prism_loop_context.py` — no sync mechanism needed
  - Project skills at `.claude/skills/` are natively discovered by Claude Code and auto-injected into PRISM agents via `prism:` frontmatter metadata

## [2.2.2] - 2026-02-09

### Fixed
- **prism-loop command** — Added missing `--session-id "${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}"` flag to `commands/prism-loop.md` (the command file that actually executes). SKILL.md had the fix from v2.2.1 but the command file did not, causing session isolation to not work.
- **setup_prism_loop.py** — Removed dead `os.environ.get("CLAUDE_SESSION_ID")` fallback that could never work since `${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}` is a Claude Code template variable, not an environment variable
- Cleaned up unused `import os` from setup script

## [2.2.1] - 2026-02-07

### Fixed
- **PRISM Loop Session Isolation** — Fixed cross-session pollution when running multiple Claude Code terminals
  - Stop hook now uses `session_id` from Claude Code's official hook JSON input instead of unreliable `CLAUDE_CODE_SSE_PORT` environment variable
  - Removed backwards-compatibility fallback that allowed "unknown" sessions to match each other
  - Setup script now receives `${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}` from skill invocation for reliable session tracking
  - Prevents PRISM workflow from one terminal hijacking unrelated sessions in another terminal

- **Windows Unicode Encoding** — Fixed `UnicodeEncodeError` on Windows when printing checkmarks and other Unicode characters
  - Added UTF-8 encoding wrapper to 4 Python scripts that use Unicode output
  - Affected scripts: `prism_stop_hook.py`, `setup_prism_loop.py`, `prism_approve.py`, `validate_file_first.py`
  - Uses `io.TextIOWrapper` with `errors='replace'` for graceful fallback on incompatible terminals

### Changed
- **prism-loop SKILL.md** — Updated command to pass `--session-id "${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}"` to setup script
- **setup_prism_loop.py** — Now accepts `--session-id` argument for reliable session identification

## [2.2.0] - 2026-02-06

## [1.3.0] - 2025-10-24

### Added
- **Complete Token Documentation** - Comprehensive token flow analysis and documentation
  - Documented distinction between runtime tokens and template placeholders
  - Added TOKEN RESOLUTION section to workflow header explaining {epic} and {story} are templates
  - Enhanced draft_story output documentation with concrete examples
  - Added `actual` field to all artifacts showing example resolved paths
  - Documented how SM agent determines epic/story identifiers during execution
  - Documented how QA agent generates {YYYYMMDD} timestamps and {slug} values

### Changed
- **Command Parameter Consistency** - Fixed all token naming drift
  - Updated all QA commands: `{story_file}` → `{story}` to match skill signatures
  - Fixed: `*risk {story}`, `*design {story}`, `*review {story}`, `*gate {story}`
  - Fixed: `*validate-story-draft {story}` to match PO skill signature
  - All commands now include clarification: "Parameter {story} receives value from: $draft_story.output.story_file"
  - Established clear pattern: workflow internal variables use `story_file`, commands use `{story}`

- **Strangler Pattern Workflow** - Complete rewrite to use actual dev commands
  - Removed non-existent commands: `task`, `execute-checklist`, `develop`, `validate`
  - Simplified from 7 granular steps to 2 high-level orchestration steps
  - Now uses actual commands: `strangler` (delegates to tasks/strangler-pattern.md) and `run-tests`
  - Updated version to 1.1.0
  - Workflow now properly separates orchestration (workflow) from implementation (skills/tasks)

### Fixed
- **Token Flow Validation** - All tokens fully accounted for
  - Verified single runtime token (`story_file`) flows correctly through all 7 dependent steps
  - Confirmed all dependency chains ensure token availability
  - Validated all template placeholders are properly documented as patterns, not runtime values
  - All artifacts section now clearly shows template patterns vs actual examples

### Validated
- 100% token accountability: 1 runtime token, 7 consumers, 0 undefined references
- All workflow actions (11 total) map to existing skill commands
- Token dependency chain verified: all steps requiring story_file properly depend on draft_story
- Command parameter consistency: all skills and workflows use matching token names
- Cross-system validation: skills, workflows, shared docs, utils all consistent

## [1.2.0] - 2025-10-24

### Added
- **Explicit Story Context Pattern** - CRITICAL FIX for workflow continuity
  - Added `output.story_file` to `draft_story` step to capture created story path
  - Added `input.story_file` to ALL subsequent workflow steps (risk_assessment, test_design, validate_story, implement_tasks, qa_review, address_review_issues, update_gate)
  - Story file path explicitly flows from draft_story through all phases
  - Added comprehensive header documentation explaining story context pattern
  - Each step now documents the exact command with {story_file} parameter

### Changed
- **Workflow Documentation** - Enhanced clarity for story file handling
  - All QA commands now show explicit `Command: *risk {story_file}` format
  - All Dev commands document story file context awareness
  - Updated workflow notes to emphasize single source of truth pattern
  - Added "Uses story file from draft_story step as input" to all relevant steps

### Fixed
- **Story Context Continuity** - Resolved critical ambiguity in workflow
  - Previous version: Workflow didn't specify which story file to work on after creation ❌
  - Current version: Explicitly passes story_file path from draft_story to all dependent steps ✅
  - Ensures all agents (QA, PO, Dev) work on the SAME story throughout lifecycle
  - Eliminates confusion about which file in docs/stories/ to operate on
