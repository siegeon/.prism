# PRISM Development System

**Version 3.9.0** - Compaction Resilience + Stop Hook Hardening

A comprehensive MCP server that accelerates LLM-powered development with consistency, measurement, and quality gates.

## How to Use PRISM

PRISM has three tiers of usage. Start with the loop, drop to an agent when you need focused expertise, invoke a skill directly for one-off operations.

### Tier 1: `/prism-loop` — Automated Team

Give it a PRD or requirements and the loop drives SM → QA → DEV automatically through Planning → RED (failing tests) → GREEN (implementation) → verification with quality gates. **This is the primary entry point for feature work.**

```bash
/prism-loop implement user authentication based on PRD-auth.md
```

### Tier 2: Agent Commands — Focused Problem-Solving

Activate a specific agent when you have a targeted problem, not the full cycle:

```bash
/dev story-001    # Implement against an existing story
/qa story-001     # Validate quality for a specific story
/sm               # Plan and size stories manually
/architect        # Design systems and make tech decisions
```

### Tier 3: Skills — Individual Operations

Invoke any skill directly for a specific task. Skills are building blocks that agents use, but you can call them directly too:

```bash
/probe-estimation            # Size a story with PROBE method
/test-design                 # Design test strategy
/byos scaffold my-skill      # Create a team skill
/execute-checklist story-dod  # Run a quality checklist
```

**Or let skills auto-activate** — say "design the architecture" and the Architect skill activates, say "implement the story" and Dev activates.

## What is PRISM?

PRISM is a software engineering methodology that combines proven practices into a unified framework:

- **P**redictability (PSP/TSP) - Structured processes, measurement, quality gates
- **R**esiliency (TDD/XP) - Test-driven development, extreme programming
- **I**ntentionality (Clean Code/SOLID) - Clear, purposeful design decisions
- **S**ustainability (XP/Craftsmanship) - Long-term maintainable practices
- **M**aintainability (DDD) - Domain-driven design for complex logic

**In Practice:** PRISM provides workflows, automation, agent personas, and quality gates that enforce these principles automatically.

> **Important:** PRISM is an MCP server for Claude Code, not a web application.
>
> **What PRISM is built with:**
> - MCP server with Claude Code integration: Skills, sub-agents, hooks, workflows, slash commands
> - [Core Development Workflow](docs/reference/workflows/core-development-cycle.md): Story Master → Dev → QA → Peer
> - Python automation, YAML configs, Markdown templates
>
> **What PRISM is NOT:**
> - Not a web app (no Node.js, React, databases, deployment infrastructure)
> - Test documents (epic-999, tech-stack.md) are fictional validator test fixtures

## Key Features

### Automated Quality Validation
**11 specialized sub-agents** validate your work at critical checkpoints:
- 5 for Story Masters (structure, content, alignment, compliance, decomposition)
- 3 for Developers (file tracking, test running, linting)
- 2 for QA (requirements tracing, quality gates)
- 1 for Documentation (link validation)

**Impact:** ~1.3 hours saved per story, 100% compliance, <5% rework rate

### Role-Based Agent System
7 specialized agent personas for different roles:
- `/architect` - System design and architecture
- `/sm` - Story planning with PSP/PROBE sizing
- `/dev` - Feature development with TDD
- `/qa` - Quality assurance and testing
- `/po` - Product owner and requirements
- `/support` - Issue validation and reproduction

### Workflow Automation
- **[Hooks](hooks/README.md)** - Event-driven enforcement that blocks invalid operations
- **[Workflows](docs/reference/workflows/README.md)** - Multi-step orchestrated processes with quality gates
- **[PRISM Loop](skills/prism-loop/SKILL.md)** - Automated TDD workflow with RED/GREEN validation
- **[Skills](skills/README.md)** - Reusable operations (estimation, test design, risk assessment, tracing)
- **[Templates](templates/README.md)** - Document generation (PRD, stories, architecture, QA gates)
- **[Checklists](skills/execute-checklist/SKILL.md)** - Quality gate validation at workflow checkpoints

### Progressive Disclosure
All documentation follows token-efficient loading:
- Level 1: Metadata (~100 tokens)
- Level 2: Core content (<2k tokens)
- Level 3: Detailed docs (loaded as needed)

## What's New

### Version 3.9.0
