# Requirements Tracer

Trace requirements from PRD through Epic, Story, Code, and Tests to verify complete coverage and identify gaps.

## Invocation Context

Called by QA agent during story review to verify:
1. All requirements are implemented
2. All functionality is tested
3. Tests follow Given-When-Then patterns where applicable
4. No orphaned code or missing traceability

## Input Expected

- **story_path** (required): Path to story file (e.g., docs/stories/epic-001/story-003-feature.md)
- **epic_reference** (optional): Epic number or path. If not provided, infer from story path or frontmatter.
- **prd_path** (optional): Path to PRD document if different from standard location

## Traceability Chain

Requirements flow through four levels:

```
PRD Requirements
    ↓
Epic Objectives & Acceptance Criteria
    ↓
Story Acceptance Criteria & Tasks
    ↓
Implementation (Code Files)
    ↓
Tests (Test Files)
```

## Validation Steps

### 1. Load Story and Extract Requirements

**Process**:
- Read story file from story_path
- Extract story acceptance criteria (all `- [ ]` items under "## Acceptance Criteria")
- Extract story tasks (all `- [ ]` items under "## Tasks")
- Extract story title and description
- Check for epic reference in frontmatter or path

**Output**:
- List of acceptance criteria
- List of tasks
- Epic reference for next step

### 2. Load Epic and Map to Story

**Process**:
- Read epic file from docs/prd/epic-{number}-{name}.md
- Extract epic objectives
- Extract epic acceptance criteria
- Map story acceptance criteria to epic acceptance criteria
- Verify story scope aligns with epic

**Validation**:
- Each story AC should map to at least one epic AC
- Story should not have ACs outside epic scope
- Identify which epic requirements this story addresses

### 3. Find Implementation Files

**Process**:
- Check story's "## Dev Agent Record > ### File List" section
- Use Glob to find related implementation files if File List empty:
  - Search by story name patterns
  - Search by feature name patterns
  - Look in common directories (src/, lib/, app/)
- Read each implementation file
- Extract key functions, classes, components, methods

**Output**:
- List of implementation files
- Key code elements per file

### 4. Find Test Files

**Process**:
- For each implementation file, find corresponding test files:
  - Pattern: `{filename}.spec.{ext}`
  - Pattern: `{filename}.test.{ext}`
  - Pattern: `test/{filename}.{ext}`
  - Pattern: `tests/{filename}.{ext}`
  - Pattern: `__tests__/{filename}.{ext}`
- Use Glob with patterns based on implementation file names
- Read each test file
- Extract test descriptions and structures

**Output**:
- List of test files
- Test cases per file

### 5. Map Requirements to Implementation

**Process**:
- For each acceptance criterion:
  - Search implementation files for related functionality
  - Use Grep to find relevant functions/methods
  - Match AC description to code implementation
  - Mark as TRACED, PARTIAL, or MISSING

**Criteria for Status**:
- **TRACED**: Clear implementation found that satisfies AC
- **PARTIAL**: Some implementation found but incomplete
- **MISSING**: No implementation found for AC

### 6. Map Implementation to Tests

**Process**:
- For each implementation file:
  - Verify corresponding test file exists
  - Check test coverage of key functions/methods
  - For each acceptance criterion, verify tests exist
  - Validate test structure (Given-When-Then if applicable)

**Test Structure Validation**:
- Look for Given-When-Then patterns in test descriptions
- Check for "describe" and "it" blocks (JS/TS)
- Check for "context" and "it" blocks (Ruby)
- Check for test function names (Python, Go)
- Verify test assertions exist

**Criteria for Status**:
- **TRACED**: Tests exist for implementation and cover AC
- **PARTIAL**: Tests exist but don't fully cover AC
- **MISSING**: No tests found for AC or implementation

### 7. Identify Gaps

**Gap Types**:

1. **Missing Implementation**
   - AC exists but no code implements it
   - Severity: CRITICAL

2. **Missing Tests**
   - Implementation exists but no tests
   - Severity: HIGH

3. **Orphaned Code**
   - Code exists but not tied to any AC
   - Severity: MEDIUM (could be technical debt or scope creep)

4. **Incomplete Test Coverage**
   - Tests exist but don't cover all scenarios
   - Severity: MEDIUM

5. **Invalid Test Structure**
   - Tests don't follow Given-When-Then pattern
   - Severity: LOW (quality issue, not coverage issue)

6. **Epic Misalignment**
   - Story AC doesn't map to any epic requirement
   - Severity: HIGH (scope creep indicator)

### 8. Calculate Coverage

**Formulas**:
- Requirements Traced = Count of ACs with status TRACED
- Requirements Total = Total count of story ACs
- Coverage Percentage = (Requirements Traced / Requirements Total) * 100

**Thresholds**:
- 100% = COMPLETE
- 80-99% = GAPS (acceptable with justification)
- <80% = MISSING (unacceptable)

## Reasoning Approach

If a reasoning template was provided in your context, you MUST follow it section by section
before reaching your conclusion. Complete each section in order. Your final output format
(JSON with traceability_status, trace_matrix, gaps, recommendation, etc.) remains the same
— the template governs your reasoning process, not your output.

If no template was provided, use your standard freeform analysis approach.

## Completion

Return JSON result to QA agent.

QA agent will:
- If APPROVE: Mark story as passing traceability requirements
- If REQUEST_TESTS: Request Dev implement missing tests
- If REQUEST_IMPLEMENTATION: Request Dev complete missing functionality
- If REJECT: Request significant rework before re-review
