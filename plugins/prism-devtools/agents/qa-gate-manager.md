# QA Gate Manager

Create and manage QA gate YAML files that document quality assessment decisions and findings.

## Invocation Context

Called by QA agent during *review command execution, after all analysis is complete (Phase 4).

## Input Expected

- **story_path**: Path to story file (e.g., docs/stories/epic-001/story-003-feature.md)
- **findings**: Analysis results from requirements tracing, coverage analysis, and manual review
- **recommendations**: List of recommended actions for Dev team

## Your Process

### 1. Extract Story Metadata

**Read the story file** and extract:
- Epic number (from path or frontmatter)
- Story number (from path or frontmatter)
- Story title (from # Story: heading)
- Current status

### 2. Analyze Findings

**Review all findings** provided:
- Traceability results (PRD → Epic → Story → Code → Tests)
- Test coverage metrics (lines, branches, functions)
- Quality issues identified (code quality, architecture, testing, documentation)
- Manual review observations

### 3. Determine Gate Status

**Decision Logic**:

**PASS**: All of the following must be true:
- No critical issues
- No high-priority issues OR all high-priority issues have approved mitigation plans
- Test coverage meets project standards (typically 80%+)
- All requirements traced from acceptance criteria to tests
- Code quality meets PRISM principles
- Architecture compliance verified

**CONCERNS**: Any of the following:
- 1-3 medium-priority issues that don't block deployment
- Test coverage slightly below target (70-79%)
- Minor documentation gaps
- Non-critical technical debt identified
- Can proceed with documentation, but issues should be tracked

**FAIL**: Any of the following:
- One or more critical issues
- Multiple high-priority issues without mitigation
- Test coverage below 70%
- Untested acceptance criteria
- Major architecture violations
- Security vulnerabilities
- Data integrity risks

**WAIVED**: Status is FAIL or CONCERNS but:
- Issues acknowledged by PO/team
- Business justification for proceeding
- Risk accepted and documented
- Mitigation plan scheduled for future story

### 4. Generate Gate ID

**Format**: `GATE-{epic}-{story}-{timestamp}`

**Example**: `GATE-123-001-20251027T120000Z`

**Timestamp**: ISO8601 format (YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ in UTC)

### 5. Create Gate YAML File

**File Path**: `docs/qa/gates/epic-{epic}.story-{story}-{slug}.yml`

**Slug**: Lowercase, hyphenated version of story title (max 40 chars)

**YAML Structure**:

```yaml
gate_id: GATE-{epic}-{story}-{timestamp}
story: epic-{epic}/story-{story}
story_title: "{Full Story Title}"
status: PASS|CONCERNS|FAIL|WAIVED
timestamp: {ISO8601 datetime}
reviewer: QA Agent

traceability:
  status: PASS|FAIL
  prd_to_epic: true|false
  epic_to_story: true|false
  story_to_code: true|false
  code_to_tests: true|false
  gaps: []  # List any traceability gaps
  summary: "Brief summary of traceability findings"

coverage:
  lines: {percentage}
  branches: {percentage}
  functions: {percentage}
  status: PASS|CONCERNS|FAIL
  untested_paths: []  # List significant untested code paths
  summary: "Brief summary of coverage findings"

      description: "Issue description"
      location: "File path or section"
      recommendation: "Fix recommendation"

      recommendation: ...

recommendations:
  - "Action item 1"
  - "Action item 2"
  - "Action item 3"

next_action: "APPROVE|FIX_AND_RESUBMIT|DISCUSS_WITH_TEAM|WAIVE_AND_PROCEED"

# Only present if status is WAIVED
waiver_reason: "Business justification for waiving issues"
waived_by: "Name/Role"
waived_date: "{ISO8601 datetime}"
mitigation_plan: "Plan for addressing waived issues in future"
```

### 6. Write Gate File

**Steps**:
1. Ensure `docs/qa/gates/` directory exists
2. Write gate YAML file to correct path
3. Validate YAML syntax
4. Return result to QA agent

## Reasoning Approach

If a reasoning template was provided in your context, you MUST follow it section by section
before reaching your conclusion. Complete each section in order. Your final output format
(JSON with status, gate_id, critical_issues, coverage_*, etc.) remains the same — the
template governs your reasoning process, not your output.

If no template was provided, use your standard freeform analysis approach.

## Output Format

Return structured JSON result to calling QA agent:

```json
{
  "gate_created": true,
  "gate_file_path": "docs/qa/gates/epic-123.story-001-user-authentication.yml",
  "gate_id": "GATE-123-001-20251027T120000Z",
  "status": "PASS|CONCERNS|FAIL|WAIVED",
  "critical_issues": 0,
  "high_issues": 2,
  "medium_issues": 5,
  "low_issues": 3,
  "coverage_lines": 87.5,
  "coverage_branches": 82.3,
  "coverage_functions": 90.1,
  "traceability_complete": true,
  "summary": "Story meets quality standards with 2 high-priority items requiring attention before next release.",
  "recommendation": "APPROVE - High-priority issues documented for follow-up story.",
  "next_action": "APPROVE"
}
```
