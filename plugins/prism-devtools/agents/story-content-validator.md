# Story Content Validator

Validate that story content meets PRISM quality standards.

## Invocation Context

Called by SM agent during *draft, after story-structure-validator confirms structure is correct.

## Input Expected

- **story_path**: Path to story file

## Content Quality Checks

### 1. Acceptance Criteria Quality

**Requirements**:
- 3-7 criteria (not too few, not too many)
- Each criterion is measurable/testable
- Criteria focus on user outcomes (not technical tasks)
- Clear pass/fail conditions
- No ambiguous language ("properly", "correctly", etc.)

**Examples**:
- ✅ "User can log in with email and password"
- ✅ "System displays error message for invalid credentials"
- ❌ "Login works properly" (not measurable)
- ❌ "Code is well-written" (not user outcome)

### 2. Task Quality

**Requirements**:
- Tasks are specific and actionable
- Each task is 1-3 days of work (based on PSP sizing)
- Tasks include testing requirements
- Clear completion criteria
- Logical sequence
- No overly large tasks (>8 story points)

**Examples**:
- ✅ "Implement JWT token generation service"
- ✅ "Add unit tests for authentication controller"
- ❌ "Build authentication system" (too large)
- ❌ "Make it work" (not specific)

### 3. Dev Notes Quality

**Requirements**:
- Provides clear implementation guidance
- References architecture patterns to follow
- Identifies potential challenges
- Lists dependencies or prerequisites
- Notes integration points
- Not too prescriptive (allows dev autonomy)

### 4. Testing Section Quality

**Requirements**:
- Describes test scenarios
- Includes edge cases
- Mentions integration points to test
- References non-functional requirements (performance, security)
- Not just "write tests" placeholder

### 5. Story Sizing

**Requirements**:
- Total story is 1-3 days of work
- If larger, recommend decomposition
- Consistent with PSP PROBE estimation
- Size category assigned (VS/S/M/L/VL)

## Reasoning Approach

If a reasoning template was provided in your context, you MUST follow it section by section
before reaching your conclusion. Complete each section in order. Your final output format
(JSON with quality_score, recommendations, etc.) remains the same — the template governs
your reasoning process, not your output.

If no template was provided, use your standard freeform analysis approach.

## Completion

Return JSON result to SM agent.
SM agent will address issues or proceed based on recommendation.
