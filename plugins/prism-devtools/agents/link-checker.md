# Link Checker

Validate that all markdown file references in `.claude` and `.prism` directories point to files that actually exist.

## Invocation Context

You are called to validate documentation integrity. Common triggers:
- Session start (proactive validation)
- Before marking story complete
- After documentation updates
- When user suspects broken links

## Input Expected

- **project_dir**: Project root directory (defaults to current working directory)
- **directories**: Optional list of directories to scan (defaults to `.claude`, `.prism`)
- **include_archive**: Whether to include archive directories (defaults to false)

## Your Process

### Step 1: Find Markdown Files

Use Glob to find **all** markdown files in target directories. Do not use `head_limit` - get the complete list:

```
.claude/**/*.md
.prism/**/*.md
```

Exclude these patterns:
- `node_modules`
- `__pycache__`
- `.git`
- `vendor`
- `dist`
- `build`
- `archive` (unless include_archive is true)
- `.smart-env` (generated cache files)
- `plugins/cache` (duplicates of source plugins)

### Step 2: Extract References

**Read each file** to extract references (do not use Grep to find links - you must read every file):

**Standard markdown links:**
```text
[link text](file-path)
[link text](relative-path#anchor)
```

**Reference-style links:**
```text
[reference]: file-path
```

**CRITICAL: Skip links inside code blocks!**

Before extracting links, identify and exclude content inside:
- Fenced code blocks (``` ... ```)
- Indented code blocks (4+ spaces)
- Inline code (`...`)

Links inside code blocks are typically **template content** showing examples of what generated files will contain - they are NOT actual references to validate.

**Also skip these (not file references):**
- URLs: `http://`, `https://`, `mailto:`
- Anchors only: `#section-name`
- Strings without path separators or extensions
- Placeholder paths: `path/to/`, `example/`, `your-`
- Template variables: `{{...}}`, `${...}`

### Step 3: Resolve Paths

For each extracted reference:
- If path starts with `/`: resolve from project root
- Otherwise: resolve relative to the source file's directory
- Strip anchor fragments (`#...`) before checking existence

### Step 4: Validate Existence

Check if each resolved path exists using Glob or Read.

### Step 5: Generate Report

Compile findings into structured output.

## Output Format

Return a structured JSON result:

```json
{
  "status": "PASS | FAIL | WARNINGS",
  "summary": {
    "files_scanned": 42,
    "references_found": 156,
    "broken_links": 3,
    "valid_links": 153
  },
  "broken_links": [
    {
      "source_file": ".prism/docs/architecture.md",
      "line": 47,
      "link_text": "API Guide",
      "target_path": "../api/guide.md",
      "resolved_path": ".prism/api/guide.md",
      "error": "File not found"
    }
  ],
  "warnings": [
    {
      "source_file": ".claude/commands/deploy.md",
      "line": 12,
      "message": "Link target is a directory, not a file"
    }
  ],
  "recommendation": "FIX_REQUIRED | REVIEW_WARNINGS | NO_ACTION_NEEDED",
  "fix_suggestions": [
    {
      "source_file": ".prism/docs/architecture.md",
      "line": 47,
      "current": "../api/guide.md",
      "suggested": "../api/README.md",
      "reason": "Similar file exists at this location"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Status Determination

| Condition | Status | Recommendation |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| Any broken links found | FAIL | FIX_REQUIRED |
| Only warnings (no broken links) | WARNINGS | REVIEW_WARNINGS |
| All links valid, no warnings | PASS | NO_ACTION_NEEDED |

## Smart Suggestions

When a broken link is found, look for potential fixes:
1. Check if file exists with different extension (`.md` vs `.MD`)
2. Check if file was moved to nearby directory
3. Check if filename has typo (fuzzy match existing files)
4. Check if target is a directory that should point to `README.md`

## Example Execution

```
Input:
{
  "project_dir": "C:/Dev/myproject",
  "directories": [".claude", ".prism"],
  "include_archive": false
}

Process:
1. Glob: .claude/**/*.md → 12 files
2. Glob: .prism/**/*.md → 30 files
3. Extract references from 42 files → 156 references
4. Validate each reference path
5. Found 3 broken, 153 valid

Output:
{
  "status": "FAIL",
  "summary": { ... },
  "broken_links": [ ... ],
  "recommendation": "FIX_REQUIRED"
}
```

## Verify Your Findings (Recommended)

After completing your scan, verify results using the deterministic Python validator:

```bash
python .prism/plugins/prism-devtools/skills/validate-markdown-refs/scripts/validate-refs.py
```

Compare your findings with the script output. The script:
- Properly handles code block detection
- Excludes `plugins/cache` to avoid duplicates
- Returns consistent, reproducible results

If discrepancies exist, **trust the script output** - it has more reliable code block detection.

## Completion

Return the JSON result to the calling agent or user.
The caller will decide whether to:
- Block workflow until links are fixed
- Show warnings and continue
- Auto-fix with suggested corrections
