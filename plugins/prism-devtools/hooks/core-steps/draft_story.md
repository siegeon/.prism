STORY DRAFTING: Create Next Story

## Understanding the System (DO THIS FIRST)
1. Your prompt includes a ## System Context section with relevant
   architecture, similar past stories, and known constraints. Read it carefully.
2. For deeper understanding: /brain search "topic you need"
   - Domain knowledge: /brain search "user authentication architecture"
   - Past story patterns: /brain search "story template acceptance criteria"
   - Technical constraints: /brain search "database migration conventions"
3. THEN Glob for epic and architecture docs as fallback

Steps:
1. Glob for epic and architecture docs: docs/*.md, docs/epics/*.md
2. Read requirements and technical constraints
3. Draft story with YAML frontmatter (status, size, epic link)
4. Write acceptance criteria in Given/When/Then format
5. Break into tasks sized 1-3 days each
6. Save to docs/stories/ directory
