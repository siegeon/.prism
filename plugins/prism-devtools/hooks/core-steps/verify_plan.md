PLAN VERIFICATION: Check Story Completeness

## Understanding the System (DO THIS FIRST)
1. Your prompt includes a ## System Context section with relevant
   architecture and past story learnings.
2. For deeper context: /brain search "topic you need"
   - Architecture details: /brain search "data model for users"
   - Past similar work: /brain search "authentication story learnings"
3. THEN read the story file and verify coverage

Steps:
1. Read the original prompt/requirements from workflow context below
2. Read the story file just drafted
3. Extract every distinct requirement from the prompt
4. For each requirement, find the AC(s) that cover it
5. Write a ## Plan Coverage section in the story with:
   | # | Requirement | AC(s) | Status |
   Each must be COVERED, PARTIAL, or MISSING
6. If any are MISSING: add new ACs and tasks to cover them
7. If any are PARTIAL: expand existing ACs to fully cover
8. Final coverage must have zero MISSING items

CRITICAL: The stop hook validates that the Plan Coverage section exists
and contains zero MISSING items. Do NOT stop until all requirements are COVERED.
