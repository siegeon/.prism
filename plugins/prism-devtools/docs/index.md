## 📋 Overview

**PRISM** is a Claude Code plugin system that implements a complete development methodology through automation. This documentation explains how PRISM leverages Claude Code's architecture to deliver automated quality gates, role-based workflows, and measurable outcomes.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> PRISM is built entirely on Claude Code's features—**not a web application**.
>
> **We document:**
> - Claude Code architecture: Skills, sub-agents, hooks, workflows, slash commands
> - [Core Development Workflow](./reference/workflows/core-development-cycle.md): Story Master → Dev → QA → Peer
> - Python automation, YAML orchestration, Markdown templates
>
> **Note:** Test artifacts (epic-999, tech-stack.md) are fictional examples for validator testing—they represent projects PRISM helps manage, not PRISM itself.

## 🚀 How to Use PRISM

PRISM has three tiers of usage. Start with the loop, drop to an agent when you need focused expertise, invoke a skill directly for one-off operations.

### Tier 1: `/prism-loop` — Automated Team

> **The primary entry point for feature work.** Give it a PRD or requirements and the loop drives SM → QA → DEV automatically through Planning → RED (failing tests) → GREEN (implementation) → verification with quality gates.

```bash
/prism-loop implement user authentication based on PRD-auth.md
```

📖 **Learn More:** [PRISM Loop](../skills/prism-loop/SKILL.md) · [Core Development Cycle](./reference/workflows/core-development-cycle.md)

---

### Tier 2: Agent Commands — Focused Problem-Solving

> **Activate a specific agent when you have a targeted problem.** These are for when you need one agent's expertise, not the full cycle.

```bash
/dev story-001    # Implement against an existing story
/qa story-001     # Validate quality for a specific story
/sm               # Plan and size stories manually
/architect        # Design systems and make tech decisions
```

| Agent | Command | Key Tools |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| **Developer** | [`/dev`](../commands/dev.md) | `file-list-auditor`, `test-runner`, `lint-checker` |
| **QA Engineer** | [`/qa`](../commands/qa.md) | `requirements-tracer`, `qa-gate-manager`, [Test Design](../skills/test-design/SKILL.md) |
| **Story Master** | [`/sm`](../commands/sm.md) | `story-structure-validator`, `epic-analyzer`, [PROBE](../skills/probe-estimation/SKILL.md) |
| **Architect** | [`/architect`](../commands/architect.md) | System design, tech decisions |
| **Product Owner** | [`/po`](../commands/po.md) | Requirements, backlog management |
| **Support** | [`/support`](../commands/support.md) | Issue validation with Playwright |

---

### Tier 3: Skills — Individual Operations

> **Invoke any skill directly for a specific task.** Skills are building blocks that agents use, but you can invoke them directly too.

```bash
/probe-estimation            # Size a story with PROBE method
/test-design                 # Design test strategy
/byos scaffold my-skill      # Create a team skill
/execute-checklist story-dod  # Run a quality checklist
```

**Or let skills auto-activate** — say "design the architecture" and the Architect skill activates, say "implement the story" and Dev activates.

## ⚙️ Core Systems

### 🤖 Sub-Agent Validation System

**11 specialized validators** running at quality checkpoints—isolated execution prevents context pollution during implementation.

> [!NOTE]
> **Why sub-agents?** Traditional "check the story" in main context loads entire story into memory, reducing tokens available for implementation. Sub-agents validate in isolation, then report back concisely.

| Agent | Purpose | Runs When |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| `story-structure-validator` | Template compliance | Story creation |
| `story-content-validator` | Quality scoring (0-100) | After structure passes |
| `epic-alignment-checker` | Scope creep detection | Before approval |
| `architecture-compliance-checker` | Tech stack validation | Before approval |
| `epic-analyzer` | Decomposition suggestions | Epic breakdown |
| `file-list-auditor` | Git changes match story | Development complete |
| `test-runner` | Test execution, coverage | Development complete |
| `lint-checker` | Code standards | Development complete |
| `link-checker` | Documentation link validity | Documentation updates |
| `requirements-tracer` | PRD → Code coverage | QA review |
| `qa-gate-manager` | Quality gate YAML | QA decision |

📈 **Impact:** ~1.3 hours saved per story · 95%+ traceability · <5% rework

### 🔄 Workflows

**Multi-step orchestration** connecting roles, handoffs, and quality gates.

> [!NOTE]
> **Core Development Cycle** is the primary workflow:
> ```
> Story Master (plan) → Developer (implement) → QA (validate) → Peer (review)
> ```

**Each phase includes:**
- ✅ **Entry criteria** (what must be ready)
- 🎯 **Execution steps** (what to do)
- 🛡️ **Quality gates** (sub-agent validations)
- 🏁 **Exit criteria** (what signals completion)
- 🤝 **Handoff protocol** (what next role receives)

📖 **Key Workflow:** [Core Development Cycle](./reference/workflows/core-development-cycle.md)
📂 **All Workflows:** [Workflows Directory](./reference/workflows/README.md)

> [!TIP]
> **Automated TDD:** Use `/prism-loop` for automated RED/GREEN workflow with validation gates.
> Auto-progresses through Planning, TDD RED, and TDD GREEN phases with stop hooks to validate test state.
> See [PRISM Loop](../skills/prism-loop/SKILL.md)

---

### 🎯 Skills

**Auto-activating agent personas** that load when user intent matches role capabilities.

**Skills vs Commands:**

| Type | Example | When to Use |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **Commands** | `/dev` | "I know I need the developer role" |
| **Skills** | Auto-activates | "Help me with this code" → Dev skill activates |

**Core Skills:**
- `prism-devtools:dev` - Development with TDD
- `prism-devtools:qa` - Quality assurance
- `prism-devtools:sm` - Story planning
- `prism-devtools:architect` - System design
- `prism-devtools:po` - Product owner
- `prism-devtools:peer` - Code review
- `prism-devtools:support` - Issue validation

🏗️ **Project Skills:** [BYOS](../skills/byos/SKILL.md) — Create team skills shared via git with automatic PRISM agent assignment

---

### 🪝 Hooks

**Event-driven automation** enforcing workflow integrity—runs on tool calls, file changes, session start.

> [!WARNING]
> Hooks prevent errors by blocking invalid operations:
> - `enforce-story-context.py` - Blocks `/dev`, `/qa` commands without active story
> - `track-current-story.py` - Captures current story context
> - **Validation hooks** - Warn on missing story sections

**Why hooks?** Prevent "I forgot to set the story context" → 30 min debugging session. Hook blocks command instantly with helpful message.

📖 **Learn More:** [Hooks System](../hooks/README.md) · [Hooks Manager Skill](../skills/hooks-manager/SKILL.md)

---

### ⌨️ Commands (Slash Commands)

**13 slash commands** for manual workflow control:

```
/architect  /sm  /dev  /qa  /po  /peer  /support
/file-first  /prism-approve  /prism-loop  /prism-reject  /prism-status  /cancel-prism
```

**Each command:**
1. ✅ Loads role persona (identity, responsibilities, tools)
2. 🔄 Activates relevant workflows
3. ⚙️ Provides role-specific commands (e.g., `/dev` enables `*develop-story`)

📂 **All Commands:** [Commands Directory](../commands/README.md)

## 📊 System Status

> [!NOTE]
> **Current Version:** `2.4.0`

### What's New in v2.4.0

- **Pre-commit quality gate** — Git hook blocks commits with broken links, terminology issues, or hardcoded paths. Runs validate-docs.py + check-portability.py automatically.
- **check-portability.py** — Deterministic PC001-PC005 scanner with 5-layer exemption logic (placeholders, output blocks, rule docs, tracebacks, historical sections).
- **validate-all skill** — Run all validation checks in one shot. Say "validate all" or run `python skills/validate-all/scripts/validate-all.py`.

### Highlights from v2.3.x

- **Bring Your Own Skill (BYOS)** — Teams can now create project-level skills shared via git with automatic PRISM agent assignment. `/byos scaffold`, `/byos validate`, `/byos list` commands. Leverages existing `discover_prism_skills()` infrastructure — no sync needed.

### Highlights from v2.2.x

- **prism-loop TDD orchestration** - Automated RED/GREEN workflow with validation gates and phase auto-progression
- **Sub-agents validation system** - 11 specialized agents including `link-checker`
- **File-first architecture** - Glob/Grep/Read-based codebase understanding as a core principle
