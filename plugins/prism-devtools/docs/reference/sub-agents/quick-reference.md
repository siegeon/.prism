## When Sub-Agents Run

| Role | Command | Phase | Sub-Agents | Purpose |
|------|---------|-------|------------|---------|
| **SM** | `/sm *draft` | Story Creation | structure → content → epic-align → arch-comply | Validate story structure and quality |
| **SM** | `/sm *decompose` | Epic Breakdown | epic-analyzer | Suggest story decomposition |
| **Dev** | `/dev *develop-story` | Pre-Review | file-list → test-runner → lint-checker | Verify implementation quality |
| **QA** | `/qa *review` | Review | requirements-tracer → qa-gate-manager | Trace requirements, create gate |

## Common Issues & Quick Fixes

### SM: story-structure-validator

| Issue | Quick Fix |
|-------|-----------|
| Missing '## Testing' section | Add `## Testing` heading with test scenarios |

| Missing As a/I want/So that | Rewrite story statement with user story template |

### SM: story-content-validator

| Issue | Quick Fix |
|-------|-----------|
| AC not measurable | Avoid "properly", "correctly" - use specific outcomes |
| Tasks too large (>3 days) | Split into smaller sub-tasks (1-3 days each) |
| Dev Notes too vague | Add architecture references, patterns, challenges |
| Testing section placeholder | Write actual test scenarios and edge cases |
| Quality score <70 | Address all CONCERNS/FAIL checks |

### SM: epic-alignment-checker

| Issue | Quick Fix |
|-------|-----------|
| Scope creep detected | Remove ACs outside epic scope OR update epic first |
| AC doesn't map to epic | Add missing requirement to epic OR remove from story |
| Missing epic reference | Add epic number to story frontmatter or path |

### SM: architecture-compliance-checker

| Issue | Quick Fix |
|-------|-----------|
| Unapproved technology | Use approved alternatives from tech-stack.md |
| Pattern violation | Follow architecture patterns (no direct DB access in controller) |
| Boundary violation | Respect module/service boundaries |

### Dev: file-list-auditor

| Issue | Quick Fix |
|-------|-----------|
| Files missing from list | Add to File List: src/utils/helper.ts |
| Extra files in list | Remove deleted files from File List |
| Test files not listed | Include test files in File List |

### Dev: test-runner

| Issue | Quick Fix |
|-------|-----------|
| 3 tests failing | Fix failing tests before marking Review |
| No tests found | Add test files, configure test command |
| Wrong test framework detected | Configure correct command in core-config.yaml |

### Dev: lint-checker

| Issue | Quick Fix |
|-------|-----------|
| ESLint: 12 violations | Run `npm run lint:fix` or fix manually |
| Formatting inconsistent | Run `npm run format` (Prettier, Black, etc.) |
| No linter configured | Add linter to project (ESLint, Pylint, RuboCop) |

### QA: requirements-tracer

| Issue | Quick Fix |
|-------|-----------|
| AC 'Fast load time' not traced | Add performance test OR mark as NFR |
| Missing test for utils.ts | Add test file: utils.test.ts |
| Orphaned code detected | Remove unused files OR document reason |
| Coverage <70% | Add tests for untested code paths |

### QA: qa-gate-manager

| Issue | Quick Fix |
|-------|-----------|
| Status: FAIL | Address critical issues before proceeding |
| Status: CONCERNS | Document concerns, track for future sprint |
| Missing gate file | Check docs/qa/gates/ directory exists |

- [ ] Use story template with all 9 sections
- [ ] Write measurable ACs (3-7 criteria)
- [ ] Size tasks appropriately (1-3 days each)
- [ ] Reference architecture in Dev Notes
- [ ] Include specific test scenarios
- [ ] Aim for quality score 85+
- [ ] Verify epic alignment before approving
- [ ] Check tech stack compliance

### Developer (Dev)

- [ ] Update File List as you develop
- [ ] Run tests frequently, fix failures immediately
- [ ] Address linting violations during development
- [ ] Follow story's Dev Notes guidance
- [ ] Implement all Testing section scenarios

- [ ] Update Change Log with each commit
- [ ] Never mark "Review" with failing validators

### QA Reviewer

- [ ] Verify PRD → Epic → Story → Code → Tests chain
- [ ] Check test quality, not just coverage
- [ ] Validate edge case handling
- [ ] Review non-functional requirements
- [ ] Document findings in structured format
- [ ] Follow gate status logic objectively
- [ ] Create gate YAML file with clear recommendation
- [ ] Track concerns for future improvement

   ↓ (if score ≥70)
3. epic-alignment-checker      [Sonnet]  → Maps to epic?
   ↓ (if aligned)
4. architecture-compliance     [Sonnet]  → Approved tech?
   ↓ (if compliant)
✅ STORY APPROVED
```

### Dev Implementation

✅ READY FOR REVIEW
```

### QA Review

```
1. [QA analyzes implementation]
   ↓

## Decision Matrix

| Situation | Best Action |
|-----------|-------------|
| Story structure invalid | Fix required sections, re-run SM |
| Quality score 60-69 | Address FAIL checks, aim for 70+ |
| Quality score <60 | Major revision needed, start over |
| Scope creep detected | Update epic OR remove ACs |
| File List mismatch | Update to match git changes |
| Tests failing | Fix tests before marking Review |
| Linting violations | Run lint:fix, address manually |
| Coverage <70% | Add tests for untested paths |
