# QA Reference Documentation

**Quality Assurance in PRISM** - Test architecture, quality gates, and validation workflows

---

## Overview

The QA system in PRISM provides comprehensive quality validation through:

- **Quality Gates** - Advisory checkpoints with clear PASS/CONCERNS/FAIL/WAIVED decisions
- **Requirements Traceability** - PRD → Epic → Story → Code → Tests mapping
- **Risk Assessment** - Probability × Impact analysis for brownfield changes
- **Test Design** - Strategic test planning before implementation
- **Review Workflows** - Systematic validation of completed work

**Philosophy**: Advisory excellence over blocking. QA provides thorough analysis and clear recommendations—teams choose their quality bar.

---

## 🎯 Quick Start

### For QA Engineers

```bash
/qa                        # Activate QA role (Quinn, Test Architect)
/qa *review story-file     # Comprehensive quality review
/qa *gate story-file       # Create/update quality gate decision
```

### For Developers

Quality gates appear at key workflow checkpoints:
- After implementation (before commit)
- During code review (peer validation)
- Before production deployment

## 🤖 QA Sub-Agents

Two specialized validators run during QA workflows:

### requirements-tracer
**Purpose**: Trace PRD → Epic → Story → Code → Tests
**When**: Early in review (Phase 2)
**Output**: Traceability matrix, coverage gaps, recommendations

### qa-gate-manager
**Purpose**: Create/update gate YAML files with status decision
**When**: End of review (Phase 4)
**Output**: Gate file at `artifacts/qa/gates/`

📖 **Learn More**: [Sub-Agent System](../sub-agents/README.md)

## 🔄 QA in the Development Cycle

Quality gates appear at three key points:

### 1. Pre-Implementation (Optional)
**For high-risk changes only**

```bash
/qa *risk story-file      # Assess probability × impact
/qa *design story-file    # Plan test strategy
```

**When Required:**
- Legacy code changes
- API modifications
- Data migrations
- Performance-critical changes
- Security-sensitive changes

### 2. Post-Implementation (Recommended)
**After development, before commit**

```bash
/qa *review story-file    # Comprehensive validation
```

**Validates:**
- Requirements traceability (PRD → Tests)
- Test coverage (lines, branches, functions)
- Code quality (PRISM principles)
- Architecture compliance
- NFR satisfaction (security, performance, reliability)

### 3. Gate Decision (Automatic)
**Creates gate file during review**

Output: `artifacts/qa/gates/{epic}.{story}-{slug}.yml`

**Status**: PASS | CONCERNS | FAIL | WAIVED

---

## 📂 File Locations

Quality artifacts are organized in `artifacts/qa/`:

```
artifacts/qa/
├── gates/                    # Quality gate decisions (YAML)
│   ├── 1.2-user-auth.yml
│   └── 1.3-api-integration.yml
├── assessments/              # Risk and test design documents
│   ├── 1.2-risk-2025-11-19.md
│   └── 1.2-test-design-2025-11-19.md
└── reports/                  # Review reports and findings
```

**Configuration**: `core-config.yaml:2-3`
```yaml
qa:
  qaLocation: artifacts/qa
```

## 🎯 Gate Status Quick Reference

| Status | Meaning | Next Action |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **✅ PASS** | Ready to commit | Proceed with confidence |
| **⚠️ CONCERNS** | Minor issues, non-blocking | Document, track, can proceed |
| **❌ FAIL** | Critical issues found | Fix required, return to dev |
| **📋 WAIVED** | Issues accepted with rationale | Business decision to proceed |

📖 **Detailed Criteria**: [Gate Decision Criteria](./reference/gate-decision-criteria.md)

## 💡 QA Principles

### 1. Advisory Excellence
- Provide thorough analysis and recommendations
- Teams decide their quality bar
- Never arbitrarily block progress

### 2. Depth As Needed
- Go deep based on risk signals
- Stay concise for low-risk changes
- Use LLMs to accelerate focused analysis

### 3. Requirements Traceability
- Map all stories to tests
- Use Given-When-Then patterns
- Validate every acceptance criterion

### 4. Risk-Based Testing
- Assess probability × impact
- Prioritize by risk level
- Focus effort where it matters

### 5. Technical Debt Awareness
- Identify and quantify debt
- Distinguish must-fix from nice-to-have
- Provide improvement suggestions with context
