# QA Workflows

**How quality assurance integrates into the PRISM development cycle** - Workflows, handoffs, and quality gates

---

## Overview

Quality assurance in PRISM is **integrated throughout the development lifecycle**, not bolted on at the end. This document explains QA's role in each workflow phase, handoff protocols, and when quality gates are created.

**Key Principle:** Advisory excellence through systematic validation at key checkpoints.

---

## 🔄 QA in the Core Development Cycle

The [Core Development Workflow](../../workflows/core-development-cycle.md) has four main phases:

```
📝 Story Master (Planning)
      ↓
💻 Developer (Implementation)
      ↓
✅ QA (Validation) ← Quality Gate Created Here
      ↓
👁️ Peer Review (Final Check)
      ↓
🚀 Commit & Deploy
```

**QA Phase Focus:** Validate work meets quality standards before proceeding to peer review and deployment.

---

## 📊 Workflow Phase Details

### Phase 1: Planning (Story Master)

**QA Role:** Minimal (story validation only)

**Activities:**
- ✅ Validate story structure (story-structure-validator)
- ✅ Validate story content quality (story-content-validator)
- ✅ Check epic alignment (epic-alignment-checker)
- ✅ Verify architecture compliance (architecture-compliance-checker)

**Quality Focus:**
- Story has measurable acceptance criteria
- Requirements are clear and testable
- Scope aligns with epic and architecture

**No Gate Created** - Story validation is separate from implementation quality gates.

**Handoff to Dev:**
- ✅ Story structure validated
- ✅ Acceptance criteria measurable
- ✅ Epic and architecture alignment verified
- 📄 Story file ready for implementation

---

### Phase 2: Implementation (Developer)

**QA Role:** Available for consultation (not active validation)

**Developer Self-Checks:**
- Write tests for acceptance criteria (TDD)
- Run tests locally, verify passing
- Check coverage locally (aim for 80%+)
- Update story file list with changed files

**QA Consultation Available:**
- Questions about test strategy
- Clarification on acceptance criteria
- Guidance on edge cases to test

**No Gate Created** - Gates created after implementation complete.

**Ready for QA When:**
- ✅ All acceptance criteria implemented
- ✅ Tests written and passing
- ✅ Coverage ≥70% (ideally 80%+)
- ✅ Story file list updated
- ✅ No known critical issues

---

### Phase 3: QA Review (Quality Assurance)

**QA Role:** PRIMARY - Comprehensive validation and gate creation

**Entry Criteria:**
- Developer marks implementation complete
- Tests passing locally
- Story file list updated

**QA Workflow:**

#### Step 1: Initiate Review

**Command:**
```bash
/qa *review docs/stories/epic-1/story-3-feature.md
```

**Agent:** Quinn (Test Architect) activates

**Duration:** 10-15 minutes (standard), 30-60 minutes (high-risk)

---

#### Step 2: Context Loading

**Activities:**
- Read story file (acceptance criteria, scope)
- Load parent epic (scope alignment check)
- Load PRD (requirements traceability)
- Identify changed files (from story or git diff)
- Load test files

**Output:** Complete context for validation

---

#### Step 3: Validator Execution

**Sub-Agents Run:**

**requirements-tracer**
- Traces PRD → Epic → Story → Code → Tests
- Identifies gaps (untested criteria, missing tests)
- Output: Traceability matrix + gap analysis

**test-runner**
- Executes test suite
- Measures coverage (lines, branches, functions)
- Output: Coverage percentages + test results

**lint-checker**
- Verifies code meets style standards
- Output: Linting errors/warnings

**file-list-auditor**
- Verifies story file list matches git changes
- Output: Confirmation or discrepancies

**Duration:** 2-10 minutes (parallelized)

---

#### Step 4: Findings Analysis

**Activities:**
- Aggregate validator outputs
- Categorize issues by severity (critical/high/medium/low)
- Evaluate coverage vs thresholds
- Validate each acceptance criterion has test evidence
- Check non-functional requirements (security, performance, etc.)

**Output:** Structured findings object

---

#### Step 5: Status Determination

**Activities:**
- Apply decision algorithm to findings
- Determine gate status: PASS | CONCERNS | FAIL | WAIVED
- Generate status reason (explanation with key metrics)

**Decision Logic:** [Gate Decision Criteria](../reference/gate-decision-criteria.md)

**Output:** Gate status + rationale

---

#### Step 6: Gate File Creation

**Sub-Agent:** qa-gate-manager

**Activities:**
- Create YAML file with status + evidence
- Write to `artifacts/qa/gates/{epic}.{story}-{slug}.yml`
- Include coverage, traceability, issues, recommendations

**File Schema:** [Gate File Structure](../reference/gate-file-structure.md)

**Output:** Gate file at `artifacts/qa/gates/`

---

#### Step 7: Review Report

**Activities:**
- Generate comprehensive review report
- Summarize findings for team
- Provide actionable recommendations
- Link to gate file

**Output:** Review summary displayed to developer

---

**Exit Criteria:**
- ✅ Gate file created
- ✅ Review report generated
- ✅ Findings communicated to team

**Possible Outcomes:**

**✅ PASS** → Ready for peer review and commit
**⚠️ CONCERNS** → Document issues, track in backlog, can proceed
**❌ FAIL** → Return to dev, fix critical issues, re-review
**📋 WAIVED** → Business decision to proceed with documented risks

---

### Phase 4: Peer Review (Code Review)

**QA Role:** Gate file available for peer reviewer

**Peer Reviewer Checks:**
- Review code changes (logic, clarity, maintainability)
- Review gate file (quality validation results)
- Verify gate status acceptable for merge
- Ask questions if gate concerns unclear

**QA Support:**
- Available to explain gate decisions
- Clarify severity classifications
- Discuss quality tradeoffs

**Handoff to Commit:**
- ✅ Code changes reviewed by peer
- ✅ Gate file reviewed and accepted
- ✅ Any CONCERNS documented in backlog
- ✅ All FAIL issues resolved (or WAIVED)

---

### Phase 5: Commit & Deploy

**QA Role:** Gate file committed with code

**Activities:**
- Gate file included in commit
- Gate status visible in PR description
- Gate data feeds into metrics dashboards

**Quality Metrics Tracked:**
- Gate pass rate (target: 80%+ first pass)
- Average coverage (target: 80-85%)
- Critical issues per story (target: <1)
- Rework rate (target: <5%)

---

## 🎯 QA Workflow Variants

### Standard Story Workflow (Low-Medium Risk)

**Typical for:** New features, refactorings, non-critical bug fixes

**Steps:**
```
1. Story Master creates story
2. Developer implements
3. Developer requests QA review: /qa *review story-file
4. QA creates gate (PASS/CONCERNS/FAIL)
5. If PASS/CONCERNS: Proceed to peer review
   If FAIL: Fix and re-review
6. Commit and deploy
```

**QA Time:** 10-15 minutes

**Gate Pass Rate:** 80-85% first pass (typical)

---

### Brownfield/High-Risk Workflow

**Typical for:** Legacy code changes, API modifications, data migrations, security-sensitive features

**Steps:**
```
1. Story Master creates story
2. QA runs risk assessment: /qa *risk story-file
   → Output: Risk matrix (probability × impact)
3. QA creates test design: /qa *design story-file
   → Output: Test strategy document
4. Developer implements with risk awareness
5. Developer requests QA review: /qa *review story-file
   → QA validates risk mitigation
   → Gate includes risk validation
6. If PASS/CONCERNS: Proceed
   If FAIL: Fix and re-review
7. Commit and deploy
```

**QA Time:**
- Risk assessment: 15-30 minutes
- Test design: 20-40 minutes
- Post-implementation review: 30-60 minutes
- **Total: 65-130 minutes**

**Gate Pass Rate:** 60-70% first pass (higher failure rate expected for high-risk)

---

### Prototype/Experimental Workflow

**Typical for:** Prototypes, spikes, proof-of-concepts

**Steps:**
```
1. Story Master creates story (marked as prototype)
2. Developer implements with minimal testing
3. Developer requests QA review: /qa *review story-file
4. QA gate shows FAIL (expected - low coverage)
5. Team decides to WAIVE for prototype phase
6. Gate updated with waiver rationale
7. Prototype deployed for feedback
8. [Later] If production-bound: Full test suite required
```

**QA Time:** 5-10 minutes (quick review + waiver documentation)

**Gate Status:** Usually WAIVED (by design)

**Important:** Waiver must include conditions for production readiness.

---

## 📊 Quality Metrics Integration

Gates feed into project quality metrics:

### Per-Story Metrics

From each gate file:
- Coverage % (lines, branches, functions)
- Issue count by severity
- Traceability %
- Gate status (PASS/CONCERNS/FAIL/WAIVED)
- Review duration

### Aggregate Team Metrics

Across all gates:

**Gate Pass Rate** = (PASS gates) / (Total gates)
- Target: 80%+ first pass
- Tracks: Quality discipline improving over time

**Average Coverage** = Mean coverage across all gates
- Target: 80-85%
- Tracks: Test discipline consistency

**Critical Issues Rate** = (Gates with critical issues) / (Total gates)
- Target: <5%
- Tracks: Critical quality escapes

**Rework Rate** = (Stories requiring multiple review cycles) / (Total stories)
- Target: <10%
- Tracks: Efficiency (first-time quality)

### Trend Analysis

**Example Dashboard:**
```
Gate Pass Rate Trend
100% ┤                      ╭─────
 90% ┤                ╭─────╯
 80% ┤          ╭─────╯
 70% ┤    ╭─────╯
 60% ┤────╯
     └─────────────────────────────→
     Q1   Q2   Q3   Q4   Q1
```

**Insights:**
- Improving pass rate → Team learning, quality improving
- Declining pass rate → Need training, tool issues, or complexity increase
- Stable high pass rate → Mature quality culture

## 💡 Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Test Before Review**
   - Run tests locally before requesting QA review
   - Check coverage locally (aim for 80%+)
   - Don't waste QA time on failing tests

2. **Update Story File List**
   - Ensure changed files documented in story
   - Helps QA understand scope
   - Enables file-list-auditor validation

3. **Read Gate Files Thoroughly**
   - Don't just look at status, understand findings
   - Ask QA if severity classification unclear
   - Learn from patterns in gate feedback

4. **Fix FAIL Issues Promptly**
   - Critical and high issues first
   - Re-review when complete
   - Don't accumulate quality debt

5. **Track CONCERNS**
   - Create backlog items for medium issues
   - Don't ignore non-blocking improvements
   - Build improvement momentum

---

### For QA Engineers

1. **Scale Depth to Risk**
   - 5 minutes for typo fixes
   - 15 minutes for standard features
   - 60 minutes for API changes or migrations
   - Use LLM analysis power where it matters

2. **Be Specific in Findings**
   - ❌ "Missing validation"
   - ✅ "Missing email format validation in register.js:45"
   - Include file, line, specific issue, recommendation

3. **Explain Status Decisions**
   - Status reason should educate, not just state
   - Include key metrics that drove decision
   - Help team understand decision logic

4. **Provide Actionable Recommendations**
   - Not just "fix this" but "here's how"
   - Link to documentation, examples
   - Prioritize recommendations (critical first)

5. **Maintain Consistency**
   - Apply same criteria across similar stories
   - Document exceptions to standard criteria
   - Update decision criteria as team learns

---

### For Teams

1. **Define Your Quality Bar**
   - What does PASS mean for your context?
   - Production vs prototype standards?
   - Document team-specific thresholds

2. **Review Gates in Standups**
   - "Any FAIL gates need help?"
   - "Any CONCERNS to discuss?"
   - Celebrate PASS gates with excellent metrics

3. **Track CONCERNS Systematically**
   - Create backlog items for medium issues
   - Review in sprint planning
   - Don't let CONCERNS accumulate

4. **Analyze Trends in Retrospectives**
   - Pass rate improving?
   - Coverage stable?
   - Recurring issue patterns?
   - Need training or tooling?

5. **Respect Waivers**
   - Don't abuse waiver process
   - Waivers for genuine exceptions only
   - Follow through on waiver conditions

---

## 🚧 Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Developer Disagrees with FAIL

**Situation:** Developer thinks gate should be PASS, QA says FAIL

**Resolution Process:**
1. **Review gate file together** - Understand specific findings
2. **Discuss criteria** - Which criteria triggered FAIL?
3. **Explore context** - Is this prototype vs production?
4. **Consider waiver** - Business justification for proceeding?
5. **Escalate if needed** - Tech lead or engineering manager decides

**Outcomes:**
- **Option A:** Developer fixes issues, re-review → PASS
- **Option B:** Team agrees to WAIVE with documented rationale
- **Option C:** Adjust decision criteria for future (if criteria too strict)

---

### Scenario 2: CONCERNS Gate, Should We Proceed?

**Situation:** Gate shows CONCERNS with 3 medium issues

**Decision Framework:**
1. **Review medium issues** - Are they blockers or nice-to-haves?
2. **Check coverage** - Is coverage ≥70%? All criteria met?
3. **Assess risk** - What's the impact if issues not fixed now?
4. **Document tracking** - Create backlog items for issues
5. **Decide** - Proceed or fix now?

**General Guidance:**
- **Proceed if:** Coverage acceptable, issues trackable, not production-critical
- **Fix now if:** Issues affect production stability, easy fixes (<30 min), or security-related

---

### Scenario 3: Rework After FAIL Gate

**Situation:** Developer fixes FAIL issues, requests re-review

**Re-Review Process:**
1. Developer runs tests locally, verifies fixes
2. Developer requests re-review: `/qa *review story-file`
3. QA re-runs validators (full review, not partial)
4. New gate file created, overwrites previous
5. Compare new vs old gate (should show improvement)

**Expectations:**
- **Improved coverage** (if that was the issue)
- **Fewer issues** (critical/high resolved)
- **Status improvement** (FAIL → CONCERNS or PASS)

**If Still FAIL:**
- Different issues found, or
- Original issues not fully resolved
- Continue iteration

---

### Scenario 4: Prototype Becoming Production

**Situation:** Prototype WAIVED for low coverage, now going to production

**Process:**
1. **Review waiver conditions** - What was required for production?
2. **Check current state** - Does code meet production standards?
3. **If NO:** New dev cycle to add tests, fix issues
4. **If YES:** Request full review with production criteria
5. **New gate created** - No longer WAIVED, must be PASS

**Key Point:** Waiver expires when context changes (prototype → production).
