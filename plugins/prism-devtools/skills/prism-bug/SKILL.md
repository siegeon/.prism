# PRISM Bug Report

Capture full session diagnostics and submit a structured GitHub issue for post-mortem and debugging.

## When to Use

- Something went wrong during a PRISM workflow session
- A step failed, a gate blocked unexpectedly, or validation produced strange results
- You want to file a bug report with full context attached
- Post-mortem after a session that ended badly

## How It Works

1. Reads the PRISM state file (`.claude/prism-loop.local.md`) for current step and history
2. Extracts the last ~50 tool calls from the active session transcript
3. Captures validation errors and gate results from `artifacts/qa/gates/*.yml`
4. Collects git context (branch, recent commits, dirty files)
5. Reads the plugin version from `plugin.json`
6. Uploads full transcript to a GitHub Gist for reference
7. Creates a GitHub Issue in `siegeon/.prism` with structured markdown containing all context

## Quick Start

```
/prism-bug 'description of what went wrong'
```

The description becomes the issue title prefix.

**Examples:**
```
/prism-bug 'red_gate blocked even though tests fail correctly'
/prism-bug 'stop hook crashed with ImportError on step 3'
/prism-bug 'green validation passed but tests still failing'
```

## What Gets Captured

| Source | Contents |
|--------|---------|
| State file | Current step, step history, active/paused status |
| Transcript | Last ~50 tool calls (name + input summary, errors) |
| Gate results | `artifacts/qa/gates/*.yml` if present |
| Git context | Branch, last 5 commits, dirty files |
| Plugin version | From `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` |

## Guardrails

- **No active session**: Still works — captures whatever state exists for post-mortem
- **Large transcripts**: Full JSONL uploaded to Gist; issue body contains excerpt only
- **Missing files**: Each source handled independently; missing = noted in report, not fatal
- **gh not available**: Reports error and prints the markdown locally instead

## Commands

### /prism-bug [description]

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/prism-bug/scripts/prism-bug.py" $ARGUMENTS
```

Captures diagnostics and submits a GitHub issue. Outputs the issue URL on success.
