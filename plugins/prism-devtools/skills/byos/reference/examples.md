# Example Project Skills

Three real-world examples showing project skills with PRISM agent assignment.

## 1. Team Code Standards (Dev Agent)

A skill that enforces project-specific coding patterns during implementation.

# Team Code Standards

## When to Use

- Implementing new features or fixing bugs
- Writing new modules, classes, or functions
- Refactoring existing code

## Standards

### Naming Conventions
- Services: `{Domain}Service` (e.g., `UserService`, `OrderService`)
- Repositories: `{Entity}Repository`
- DTOs: `{Entity}{Action}Dto` (e.g., `UserCreateDto`)

### Error Handling
- Always use `Result<T>` pattern instead of throwing exceptions
- Map external errors to domain-specific error types
- Log errors at the boundary, not in domain logic

### Module Structure
- One public class per file
- Group by feature, not by type
- See [detailed standards](./reference/full-standards.md) for complete rules

## Guardrails

- Do NOT skip error handling for "simple" cases
- Do NOT use generic exception types (`Exception`, `Error`)
- Do NOT create utility classes - use extension methods or domain services
```

**Why it works**: All agents see this skill in every workflow step. The `agent: dev` field is informational — it signals this skill was designed for implementation work. Agents are instructed to prefer using available skills over solving without them, so the Dev agent will naturally reach for it during implementation.

## 2. Team Test Patterns (QA Agent)

A skill that enforces project-specific test conventions during test creation and verification.

**`.claude/skills/team-test-patterns/SKILL.md`**:

```markdown
---
name: team-test-patterns
description: Enforce team test conventions when writing tests. Covers test naming, fixture patterns, assertion styles, and test data management.
version: 1.0.0
prism:
  agent: qa
  priority: 10
---

# Team Test Patterns

## When to Use

- Writing new tests (unit, integration, e2e)
- Creating test fixtures or factories
- Setting up test data

## Test Naming Convention

```
{MethodUnderTest}_{Scenario}_{ExpectedBehavior}
```

Examples:
- `CreateUser_WithValidEmail_ReturnsSuccess`
- `GetOrder_WhenNotFound_ThrowsNotFoundException`

## Test Structure

Use Arrange-Act-Assert with clear section comments:

```csharp
[Fact]
public void CreateUser_WithValidEmail_ReturnsSuccess()
{
    // Arrange
    var dto = UserFactory.CreateValid();

    // Act
    var result = _sut.CreateUser(dto);

    // Assert
    result.Should().BeSuccess();
}
```

## Test Data

- Use factory classes (`UserFactory`, `OrderFactory`) not raw constructors
- See [factory patterns](./reference/factory-patterns.md) for team conventions

## Guardrails

- NEVER use `Thread.Sleep` in tests - use async waits
- NEVER share mutable state between tests
- ALWAYS use factories for test data - no inline object creation
```

**Why it works**: All agents see this skill in every workflow step. The `agent: qa` field signals this skill was designed for test work. The QA agent will prefer using it during both test writing and verification steps, ensuring tests follow team conventions throughout.

## 3. Team Architecture Guard (Architect Agent)

A skill that ensures architecture decisions are followed during story planning.

**`.claude/skills/team-arch-guard/SKILL.md`**:

```markdown
---
name: team-arch-guard
description: Validate stories against architecture decisions and boundaries during planning. Ensures new work respects established patterns and service boundaries.
version: 1.0.0
prism:
  agent: architect
  priority: 5
---

# Architecture Guard

## When to Use

- Planning new features or stories
- Reviewing proposed changes that cross service boundaries
- Any work touching the domain model or API contracts

## Architecture Decisions

### Service Boundaries
- **User Service**: Authentication, authorization, user profiles
- **Order Service**: Order lifecycle, payments, fulfillment
- **Notification Service**: Email, SMS, push notifications

Cross-service communication MUST use events, not direct calls.

### Technology Constraints
- New APIs: REST with OpenAPI spec (no GraphQL without ADR)
- New storage: PostgreSQL (no new database engines without ADR)
- New messaging: RabbitMQ via MassTransit

### Required Checks
Before approving a story plan:
1. Does it respect service boundaries?
2. Does it use approved technology choices?
3. Does it have an ADR if introducing new patterns?
4. See [ADR index](./reference/adr-index.md) for existing decisions

## Guardrails

- BLOCK plans that violate service boundaries
- BLOCK plans that introduce unapproved technology
- REQUIRE ADR reference for any new architectural pattern
```

**Why it works**: All agents see this skill in every workflow step. The `agent: architect` field signals this skill was designed for architecture and planning work. The SM and Architect agents will prefer using it during planning steps, catching boundary violations before any code is written.
