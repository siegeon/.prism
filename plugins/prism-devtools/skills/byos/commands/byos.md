# /byos - Bring Your Own Skill

Manage project-level skills that are shared via git and auto-discovered by Claude Code and PRISM.

## Subcommands

### scaffold

Create a new project skill with directory structure and pre-filled SKILL.md.

```bash
python3 "${PRISM_DEVTOOLS_ROOT}/skills/byos/scripts/scaffold_skill.py" $ARGUMENTS
```

**Usage:**
- `/byos scaffold my-skill` - Scaffold skill with prism: block (no agent hint)
- `/byos scaffold my-skill --agent dev` - With optional agent hint (informational)
- `/byos scaffold my-skill --agent qa --priority 10` - With agent hint and priority

### validate

Validate project skill(s) for correctness.

```bash
python3 "${PRISM_DEVTOOLS_ROOT}/skills/byos/scripts/validate_skill.py" $ARGUMENTS
```

**Usage:**
- `/byos validate my-skill` - Validate specific skill
- `/byos validate` - Validate all project skills

### list

List all project-level skills with their PRISM metadata.

To list skills, scan `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` in the current project directory. For each skill found:

1. Read the SKILL.md file
2. Parse the YAML frontmatter for `name`, `description`, and `prism:` metadata
3. Display as a table with columns: Name, Description, Agent (if specified), Priority

If no `.claude/skills/` directory exists, report that no project skills are found and suggest `/byos scaffold` to create one.

## Routing

Parse `$0` (first argument) to determine which subcommand to run:

| `$0` | Action |
|------|--------|
| `scaffold` | Run scaffold script with remaining args |
| `validate` | Run validate script with remaining args |
| `list` | Execute list logic inline |
| (empty/other) | Show this help summary |
