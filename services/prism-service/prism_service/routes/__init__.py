"""Non-API HTTP routes that survive the v5.0.0 NiceGUI cutover.

These are SSE streams and static-content endpoints that pre-date the
React SPA migration. They live outside /api/* because they're not part
of the SPA's data surface — they're either pushed (SSE) or are bytes
embedded in the SPA (the graph viewer iframe).
