"""Server-side auto-drainer for Understand-Anything analyzer jobs.

Started from main.py lifespan as a daemon thread. Polls every project's
queue on a cadence; when it finds a pending job it claims it through the
standard JobQueue API and runs the analyzer via the shared
`analyzer_runner.run_analyzer`. Persists the result through the same
`understand_artifact_store.put` + `queue.complete` pipeline that the
foreground `prism understand drain` CLI uses.

Why this exists:
  v5.1's design only ran analyzers via (a) the foreground CLI on a dev
  host, or (b) a Stop hook inside an active Claude Code session. A
  Watchtower-only customer has neither, so adding a repo left the
  Understand pages empty forever. This thread closes that gap by
  picking up the queue automatically after a configure call.

When `claude` is not on PATH or unauthenticated, the loop logs once
per project per failure mode and keeps idling. No crash, no retries
storm — the next configure (or manual /api/understand/refresh) re-
enqueues, and the next poll picks back up.

Disable by setting PRISM_UNDERSTAND_DRAIN_INTERVAL=0.
