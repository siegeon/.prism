"""/api/jobs — flat view of Understand-Anything analyzer queue events.

The Understand-Anything queue lives one-file-per-project at
data/projects/<name>/understand_queue.jsonl. This endpoint joins all
projects' queues into a single chronologically-ordered job list so the
Settings → Jobs panel can show what's in flight, what's stuck, and
recent failures across the whole service.

Each row is keyed by job_id (idempotent enqueue per
(project, analyzer, target_sha, scope_hash) — see
prism_service.inference.queue.JobQueue) so re-runs of the same scope collapse
to one row whose `attempts` reflects how many times it was claimed.
